# Fullstack Developer Assessment ‚Äì Laravel + Next.js

This repository contains a **fullstack application** built as part of a programming assessment.  
It includes a **Laravel backend** (with MySQL) and a **Next.js frontend**. Users can have multiple roles, and roles are dynamically fetched from the API. Frontend uses **TypeScript** and **ShadCN UI components**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a fullstack application using **Laravel** and **React / Next.js**.
- Implement **user creation** with multiple roles.
- Display **users grouped by roles**.
- Validate forms and handle **API errors** gracefully.
- Use **modern frontend practices** (TypeScript, hooks, functional components, UI library).
- Dockerize the application for easy setup and reproducibility.

---

### ‚ö° Notes

- **React Version Choice:** Requirement mentioned React 17, but React 17 is deprecated. Using **Next.js** provides routing, SSR, and modern optimizations.

- **Architecture:** Laravel repositories and services, with global exception handling.

- **Dockerized:** Easy setup and reproducibility.
